Searching
---------

State:
	which room
	suck on/off
	clean state of all rooms

actions don't loop back to parent states even though the action might lead to the same values as the paren state.

CurrState --> Actions --> NewState (Model will tell agent what world is like as a result of action) --> GoalState 

Model
-----
Path from CurrState to GoalState -- sequence of actions

b = average branching factor (some levels might not have all the actions available)

d = depth of the shallowest goal state

m = maximum depth of the search tree

b^d is the number of nodes that are generated in the

BFS memory O(b^d) speed O(b^d)

DFS memory O(bm) speed O(b^m)
