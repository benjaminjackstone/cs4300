independence in probability
---------------------------
two random variables
cloudy and toothache

Bayes' Rule
------------
two not independent variables
evidence of the cause is measured by the effect
don't know the cause so we can't get a probability of the effect efficiently

domain expert needs to know what is the cause and what is the effect and get distribution values

conditional is inverted * close ) / other

p(m|s) = (p(s|m)p(m))/p(s)
