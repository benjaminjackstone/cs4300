Local Search
------------
hill climbing -- search neighboring states
		only local max, not global
Random Restart

Best Neighbor
	Randomly choose from equally good neighbors
	Weighted choices based on slopes
	Randomly choose from exact same neghbor states

--;Run some test cases with a defined dimension and see if it makes a difference when you rreach a 
	mesa or plateau.  Keep it small if negligible or high enough to make the difference.
--If there are ragged edges along a slope, you must allow for negative slopes in the random selection

Simulated Annealing
	--taken from metalurgy
	--slowly allow for a tight packing of the molecules
