	Physics, Instance Information, Knowledge Base
	Entailments TTE: Q is true everywhere that KB is true, it can be true in other truth assisgnments
	Question
	Proof by Contradiction: if KB & !Q then not satisfiable ->one model of truth assigments that makes statement true. Opposite for not satisfiable
