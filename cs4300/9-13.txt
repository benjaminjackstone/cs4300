Tree Search vs. Graph Search

WE need to try to eliminate duplicate states inside a tree.  The effect is called Graph Search. 

Make a hash funciton or BST or a map to look up nodes that are seen.

Graph:
	Reducing 'b'
	prune large portions

A* Search

Exhaustive Uniform Cost Search
	start at the Goal State and work up.
	I f we knew this information we could do the Priority Queue differently
	Need an Oracle to know the cost of state to get to a goal
Heuristic:
	The best guess of cost from a state to a goal.  Hence the Oracle costs are heuristics
	h(state) <= Cost_actual(state) -- admissible heuristic
	get the heuristic as large as possible without overestimating!!!
	brainstorm a few heuristics and choose the one that is largest if both admissible
	PQ = g (cost thus far) + h (heuristic)


UC
	PQ : g

Greedy
	PQ : h
