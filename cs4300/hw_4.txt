I assume we can only optimize for one or the other but not both. the runtime for the performance measure on the goal-based or the reflex agent
would be constrained by a time-limit and by searching paths within a certain grid or radius of the straight-line hypotenuse drawn from staring point to desired point, or until the nearest paths or major highways are found.
