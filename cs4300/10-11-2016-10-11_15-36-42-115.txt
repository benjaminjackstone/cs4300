agent needs to find a path to the goal

Program()
  parse Percepts();
  update agent stuff
  if queue empty:
	search for path
	store path in queue
  action = queue.pop()
  return action

Once the agent is at the goal, the agent needs to search for a path back home.

add to above code***
if at base:
	search for path to goal
elif at goal:
	search path to home
else:
	push Quit on the queue

Adversarial Search:
	2 player
	turn based
	zero-sum -- the amount win by is amount the other loses by
	perfect information -- fully observable
	CHECKERS
	 +fully observable
	 +static
	 +multi-player
	 +deterministic do they what happens upon execution of an action
	 +sequential
	 +known -- know the rules and actions
	 +discrete
	  some actions chosen by one agent and other actions chosen by the adversary and fall in the same search tree
	  game terminations can occur at various levels
